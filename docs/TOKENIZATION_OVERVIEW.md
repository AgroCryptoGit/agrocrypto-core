# ðŸ§¬ AgroCrypto Tokenization Overview

## What We Tokenize
- âœ… Carbon credits (verified, Brazilian origin)
- âœ… ESG-compliant physical commodities
- âœ… Fiat-backed settlements and invoices
- âœ… NFTs used as financial collateral

---

## How It Works
1. **Off-chain verification**
   - Asset origin + ownership validated via AI
   - Registry and documentation parsed into JSON

2. **On-chain minting**
   - Smart contract issues corresponding token (USDC, NFT, ESG-token)
   - Oracle cross-checks ESG parameters

3. **Settlement layer interaction**
   - Recorded on PostgreSQL + Blockchain
   - Integrated with MT103-style audit trail

---

## Supported Standards
- ERC-20 / ERC-721 / ERC-1155
- Lightning Network (for BTC settlements)
- ISO 20022 messaging (via API gateway)

---

## Use Cases
- Carbon credit sales via marketplace
- ESG-collateralized DeFi instruments
- Automated token grants for verified land restoration

> Every token minted represents a real asset, a verified act, and an immutable record â€” backed by AgroCryptoâ€™s AI & Trust Framework.
